What's New?:
------------

Version 1.5 Beta - August 18,1999
---------------------------------

-Game play/design issues adjusted to match the real game:
	 1) Adjusted ball speed ups to occur while balls are in air, rather than when caught.
	 2) Adjusted ball movement so that balls do not immediately reverse direction when caught.
	 3) Modified Game logic so that Game "A" only uses 2 balls.
	 4) Modified Scoring so that A scores 1 point per catch, B scores 10.
	 5) Removed "AM" & "PM" & ":" graphics, they are not part of the original lcd.
	 6) Increased responsiveness of Left & Right buttons, should be able to move the arms
	    faster now.
	 7) Ball starting positions now correct.
	 8) Adjust ball speed ups based on sequential scoring to be closer to real game.
	 9) High Scores only displayed when holding either Game "A" or Game "B" button.
	10) Added Set Time Mode after a Reset Button is pressed.
	11) Adjusted Time Logic to keep accurate time based on the time set even if different 
	    from computer's time.
-Added more keyboard commands so user never has to use mouse.
-Fixed Bug when flipping from back view to front view.
-Fixed NoSound bug in Game B mode.
-Fixed Game A,B,Time buttons reseting games, while in progress!
